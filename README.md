# All in AI Demo App
A demo app for the All in AI presentation on September 27, 2023.

Presented by Nathan Drezner ([@ndrezn](https://github.com/ndrezn)).

This application uses [Dash Chart Editor](https://github.com/BSd3v/dash-chart-editor) and the [OpenAI Python library](https://github.com/openai/openai-python) to build an application allowing users to ask questions about a dataset and persist views of their dataset with analytics associated.
